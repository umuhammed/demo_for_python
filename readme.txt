--> Greetings
-- I implemented basic version of Singly linked list, stack and queue as per the instraction
-- Also implemented simple version of graph and bfs algorithm too. I used quee from step 1
-- optimized the c function to a running time of o(n) and space coplexity of o(n)
-- I did it overnight, so, did not test the codes for edge cases
-- I will say more about my experience in the proposal
